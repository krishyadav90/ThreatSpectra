ThreatSpectra is a full-stack phishing detection website that analyzes multiple attack surfaces in one place: URLs, emails, SMS messages, and QR codes. It combines machine learning predictions with practical safety heuristics and provides a modern, interactive frontend built for real-time security checks.

## Overview

ThreatSpectra helps users quickly identify suspicious content before they click, reply, or share sensitive information.

Core capabilities:
- URL phishing analysis
- Email text phishing analysis
- SMS phishing analysis
- QR-image scanning and phishing evaluation
- Contact form with SMTP delivery to the project owner

## Website Features

Frontend highlights:
- Multi-mode scanner interface (URL, Email, SMS, QR)
- Real-time result cards with confidence scores
- Advanced quick examples for testing inputs
- Policy details panel in footer
- Responsive cybersecurity-themed UI

Backend highlights:
- Flask API with CORS enabled
- Random Forest-based URL model pipeline
- Feature-based email phishing model pipeline
- TF-IDF based SMS phishing model pipeline
- QR decoding with OpenCV and fallback preprocessing
- Contact endpoint with SMTP mail forwarding

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- pip

### Install and Run (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\KRISH\OneDrive\Desktop\Cyber Security Projects\ThreatSpectra"
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- or `http://localhost:5000`

## SMTP Configuration (Contact Form)

Set environment variables (or define them in a local `.env` file):

```powershell
$env:CONTACT_SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
$env:CONTACT_SMTP_PORT="587"
$env:CONTACT_SMTP_USERNAME="your-email@gmail.com"
$env:CONTACT_SMTP_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
$env:CONTACT_TO_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
$env:CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
$env:CONTACT_SMTP_USE_TLS="true"
```

Then restart the Flask server.

## Code Health Check (Re-run Anytime)

Use the same virtual environment and run:

```powershell
# 1) Syntax check all Python files
python -m compileall -q .

# 2) Runtime smoke check (imports app + model loaders)
python -c "import app; print('APP_IMPORT_OK')"
```

Expected result:
- `compileall` returns with no errors
- app import prints `APP_IMPORT_OK`

Latest local check status (March 29, 2026):
- `compileall`: passed
- app import smoke test: passed
